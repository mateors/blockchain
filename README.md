## What is RPC?
RPC(Remote Procedure Call) is a set of protocols and interfaces that the client interacts with blockchain system. 
The user can query the blockchain related information (such as block number, blocks, node connection, etc.) and 
send the transaction request through RPC interface.

## What are RPC Nodes?
As an RPC is the most straightforward API in which developers can communicate with servers to execute code remotely, 
they are very similar to function calls, only that they occur between two separate systems. In blockchain terms, 
a server is often referred to as a node.

## What is DAPP?
A decentralized app (also known as a dApp or dapp) operates on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network of computers.

A decentralized application is a computer application that runs on a decentralized computing system. DApps have been popularized by distributed ledger technologies such as the Ethereum blockchain, where DApps are often referred to as smart contracts.

## What Does a DAPP Need?
* Login user
* Fetch Balances (MATIC,NFTs,Tokens)
* Fetch Transactions
* Fetch Smart Contract Events
* Real Time Alerts (Contracts and users)
* Build Index- change DB state based on on-chain events
* Send Transactions

## What is Web3?
Web3 is the decentralized web. It's marked by decentralized apps (DApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) like cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. It's much stronger on personal privacy

Web3, in the context of Ethereum, refers to decentralized apps that run on the blockchain. These are apps that allow anyone to participate without monetising their personal data.

## dApp Terms
Each dApp has an on-chain part (smart contracts) and an off-chain part (server). The server is used in order to collect data from the blockchain and serve it to clients such as web and mobile apps.

* on-chain part --> smart contracts
* off-chain part --> server
