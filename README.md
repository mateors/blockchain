## What is RPC?
RPC(Remote Procedure Call) is a set of protocols and interfaces that the client interacts with blockchain system. 
The user can query the blockchain related information (such as block number, blocks, node connection, etc.) and 
send the transaction request through RPC interface.

## What are RPC Nodes?
As an RPC is the most straightforward API in which developers can communicate with servers to execute code remotely, 
they are very similar to function calls, only that they occur between two separate systems. In blockchain terms, 
a server is often referred to as a node.
